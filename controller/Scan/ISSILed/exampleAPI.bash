# NOTE: Make sure you don't write too quickly to the serial port, it can get overwhelmed by a modern computer
#       Generally this just means commands will get ignored
#       I'm using 100 ms sleeps here, but much smaller are probably sufficient

# Write to ISSI Page
# Arguments
#  - page
#  - starting address
#  - data (usually brightness) (8 bits)
#
# For brightness control, set the starting address to 0x24
# By default only page 0x00 is used
# There are 8 pages of memory (these can be cycled through for animiations)
# 144 led channels
# Page 0x0A is used for configuration
# See the datasheet for full details http://www.issi.com/WW/pdf/31FL3731C.pdf
